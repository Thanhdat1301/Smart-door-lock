# Smart-door-lock
Smart door lock design with 8051 microcontroller
## Design description
- Design a smart door lock simulation model that includes the functions of selecting the feature to enter or change the password, notify when entering an incorrect password, and when entering an incorrect password 3 times in a row, the door will be locked within 50 seconds. In addition, when entering the correct password, the motor will rotate like opening a door.
- To do this project, I used Proteus software to simulate and Keil C software to write the program.
- In this project, I use components including a 4x4 keyboard to communicate and perform features, an LCD screen to display information, a rotary motor, a buzzer and an 8051 microcontroller.
